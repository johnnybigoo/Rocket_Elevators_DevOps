							<p>Rocket Elevators residential elevators are different in every way from traditional designs. This leads many consumers to question what exactly they do differently, and why a vacuum elevator is a better solution for the home than a traditional weights-and-pulleys lift.</p>
							<p>Here is a quick look at some of the clear advantages vacuum residential elevators have over their older cousins:</p>
							
							
							<hr />

							<ul class="list-unstyled list-icons">
								<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> No need for excavation, a pit, machine room, or hoist. Vacuum elevators run entirely on self-contained mechanics.</li>
								<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Total safety. In the event of a power outage, the lift floats softly to the ground on a cushion of air and automatically opens the lower door.</li>
								<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Eco-friendly. Vacuum elevators use minimal electricity on the ascent and none on the descent. It’s all about gravity.</li>
								<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Low maintenance. Our lifts need their main seal replaced once every five years or 15,000 lifts. That’s all.</li>
								<li><i class="fa fa-check"></i> Smooth, quiet operation. Installing a vacuum elevator is the least intrusive method of handling a vertical mobility issue in your home.</li>
							</ul>
